# Command-Shell


This is one of the projects from my CS537 Operating Systems Class.

I implemented a command shell prompt. 
I specifically handled 6 different command line functions:

1. exit - exit from the command prompt
2. fg - bring job(s) into the foreground
3. bg - bring job(s) into the background
4. cd - change directories 
5. jobs - print all the jobs that are running the background or have been suspended
