# Command-Shell


This is one the projects from my CS537 Operating Systems Class.

I implemented a command shell prompt. 
I specificially handled 6 different command line functions:

exit - exit from the command prompt
fg - bring job(s) into the foreground
bg - bring job(s) into the background
cd - change directories 
jobs - print all the jobs that are running the background or have been suspended
